# Insurance Medical Cost Prediction


**Objective:**

In this project, we aim to predict the cost of treatment for individuals using linear regression and gradient descent. We will explore a dataset containing various features such as age, sex, BMI, and other relevant factors. By applying linear regression with gradient descent, we will build a model from scratch to accurately predict treatment costs based on these variables.

## Dataset Description


*   **age**: age of primary beneficiary
*   **sex**: insurance contractor gender, female, male
*   **bmi**: Body mass index, providing an understanding of body, weights that are relatively high or low relative to height,
objective index of body weight (kg / m ^ 2) using the ratio of height to weight, ideally 18.5 to 24.9
*   **children**: Number of children covered by health insurance / Number of dependents
*   **smoker**: Smoking
*   **region**: the beneficiary's residential area in the US, northeast, southeast, southwest, northwest.
*   **charges**: Individual medical costs billed by health insurance
